# Hangman-Game

This application is a basic Hangman game written in Vanilla Javascript.  Due to a lifelong love of Star Trek, a Next Generation theme was chosen to also highlight knowledge of HTML and CSS. THe CSS was entirely created, no style systems such as Bootstrap were used.

# Improvements
 As this is one of the first projects I built with Javascript, there are a few issues in placement. Ideally, furture development would start with converting the Vanilla Javascript into Jquery, as well as using a database (such as mongodb) for the words.  Plans are to revisit and convert this application when time allows.
